# Burger_hb

## Overview 
this app allows you to add a burger to a list and eat it
-------------------------------------------------------

## functionality 

## 11/4
I seem to have broken something. looking back at older commits, may have to revert back.

## 11/7 (update fix)
  It was reading the db in the terminal and on the page the entire time. However, the add burger form and devour button werent sending data to the db. I assumed it was a problem with my links in main.handlebars but after that didnt fix I started looking else where. turns out the "../../public" broke it, lesson learned. I just assumed since i could ctrl+click and read the file it was fine.
 
  ## Heroku Deployment (pending) (11/7)
   deploying 11/8 (I had it displaying the page at one point, changed config when linking to db and it broke -- will probably redo tomorrow from scratch and update link)
